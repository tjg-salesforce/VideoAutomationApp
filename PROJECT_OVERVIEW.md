## Project Context & Business Case

### Problem Statement
The current video creation workflow for Solutions Engineers at Salesforce is a fragile, time-consuming, and manual process. It is based on a brittle, desktop-centric pipeline (Google Forms, App Script, Python, Adobe After Effects) that suffers from a "cascading failure paradox." This process is inefficient, not collaborative, and requires specialized skills, leading to significant time waste (~80 hours per video).

### Vision
To build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly web platform that replaces the current system. This platform will enable Solutions Engineers (SEs) to create professional, branded, and customizable demo videos in minutes, not days or weeks. The platform will serve as a central hub for collaborative editing and a library of modular, reusable video components.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Drastically Reduced Time**: Reduce video creation time from weeks to minutes
- **Lowered Skill Barrier**: Enable SEs without video editing expertise to produce high-quality videos
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Provide a central, online platform for team members to collaboratively create and manage video projects
- **Proactive Campaigns**: The system should support automated video creation based on pre-defined templates for sales campaigns

## Architectural Blueprint: The Hybrid Microservices Model

The most viable architecture for this project is a hybrid, API-first, asynchronous microservices model. This decouples the resource-intensive rendering process from the user interface, ensuring a resilient and scalable system.

### Frontend (The Editor)
A dynamic, responsive web application built with React (likely within a Next.js framework). This will provide a real-time, low-latency editing experience. It will be the user's primary interface for selecting templates, filling in "merge fields," and arranging modular components on a timeline.

### Backend (The API & Orchestrator)
A lightweight microservice built with Node.js or Python. This service will handle all API requests for project management (saving, loading, etc.) and will act as the "producer" for rendering jobs. It will be deployed on a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku for simplified management.

### Job Queue (The Backbone)
A managed message queue is critical for resilience. Amazon SQS is the primary recommendation due to its reliability, scalability, and "pay-as-you-go" model, which is ideal for a solo developer. The job queue will hold all video render requests.

### Rendering Microservice (The Engine)
A separate, independent microservice that acts as the "consumer" for the job queue. It will pull render jobs from the queue and perform the heavy lifting. This service will use a powerful, open-source library like FFmpeg to execute the video manipulation tasks.

### Database (The Project State)
A NoSQL database is the ideal choice for its flexible, schemaless document model. Cloud Firestore is the recommended solution. It will store project data, customizable fields, component libraries, and render history. This flexibility is crucial for supporting a wide range of modular templates without complex database migrations.

### File Storage (The Assets)
All video, image, and motion graphics assets will be stored in a cloud storage solution like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This centralizes assets, eliminates the need for local file storage on SEs' machines, and provides a single source of truth for all projects.

## MVP Roadmap (3-Month Phased Plan)

This roadmap is designed to build a stable, functional MVP that proves the core concept and provides immediate value, while laying the groundwork for future features.

### Month 1: The Core Backend & Data Foundation

**Goal**: Establish a robust, asynchronous architecture that can reliably process render jobs and store project data.

**Key Milestones**:
- Set up a Node.js/Python backend on Heroku
- Integrate and configure Amazon SQS as the job queue
- Model and implement the Cloud Firestore schema for projects, templates, and components
- Develop a basic rendering microservice that can accept a simple render job and execute an FFmpeg command to combine a video and a text overlay

### Month 2: The Single-User Editor

**Goal**: Build a user-facing web application that can create and manage a single project.

**Key Milestones**:
- Set up the frontend with Next.js and React
- Build the core UI: a project dashboard, a timeline component, and a real-time preview canvas
- Connect the frontend to the backend API to save and load projects from Firestore
- Implement the "Render" button, which sends a job to the SQS queue and updates the project's status in Firestore
- Integrate a video player for preview and a basic asset library viewer

### Month 3: Asynchronous Collaboration & MVP Launch

**Goal**: Introduce the first level of collaboration by enabling shared project viewing and providing a solid user experience.

**Key Milestones**:
- Implement the "project lock" feature in Firestore. When a user opens a project for editing, a lockedBy field is updated. Other users can view the project but cannot edit it until the lock is released
- Build the dashboard to show a user's projects and their current render status
- Implement error handling and a "dead-letter queue" for failed jobs
- Deploy a working MVP that can perform the end-to-end process: create a project, fill out a template, render a video, and share a link to the final output

## Technology Stack

- Concurrent user support: 50+ users

### Business Metrics

- User adoption rate among SEs
- Template reusability rate

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rendering Performance**: Mitigated by using FFmpeg and cloud-based rendering
